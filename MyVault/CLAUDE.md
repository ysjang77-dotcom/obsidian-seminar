# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal Obsidian knowledge vault (개인 옵시디언 지식 저장소) for AI tool learning and life management. All content is written in Korean (한국어).

## Structure - PARA Method

The vault follows the PARA organizational method:

- **Projects/** - Time-bound initiatives with specific goals (e.g., 퇴직준비세미나 학습)
- **Areas/** - Ongoing areas of responsibility (e.g., 건강관리)
- **Resources/** - Reference materials and tool guides (e.g., Claude Code 사용법, AI 도구 모음)
- **Archive/** - Completed or inactive items
- **Templates/** - Reusable note templates

## Conventions

- Notes use Obsidian-flavored Markdown with `[[wikilinks]]` for bidirectional linking
- File and folder names are in Korean
- Obsidian configuration lives in `.obsidian/` and should generally not be manually edited
- New notes should be placed in the appropriate PARA category
- Use `[[backlinks]]` to connect related notes across categories

## Key Learning Focus

The vault tracks learning progress around: Claude Code CLI, Git workflows, Obsidian knowledge management, and AI tools integration.
