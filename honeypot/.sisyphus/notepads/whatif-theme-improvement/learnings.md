Starting work on whatif theme improvement plan.

## [2026-02-06T11:00:00Z] Task 1: whatif.md 전면 개편 - COMPLETED ✅

**Execution Summary:**
- Replaced entire whatif.md (122 lines → 244 lines)
- Added "Comparison과의 차이" differentiation table (6 key differences)
- Added "Scene Composition" section with 5 required elements (WHO, DOING, WHERE, RESULT, WHEN)
- Added "Immersion Techniques" section with 3 subsections (현재형, 구체적 수치, 관점 설정)
- Added concrete "좋은 예" (AI 진단 시스템 병원 시나리오)
- Added "나쁜 예" showing anti-pattern (Comparison theme confusion)
- Added "Before 언급 금지" rule in 렌더링 금지 요소 section
- Maintained color palette (#1A535C, #4ECDC4, #FF6B35, #F7FFF7)

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ All grep checks passed
- ✅ Comparison differentiation table present (8 pipes)
- ✅ Scene Composition section with 5 elements
- ✅ Immersion Techniques section complete
- ✅ Good/bad examples with concrete scenarios
- ✅ Before mention prohibition rule explicit
- ✅ File structure complete and functional

**Key Learnings:**
- What-If is now clearly "미래 비전 스냅샷" - single future scene immersion
- Comparison is "좌우 2분할" - left-right Before/After structure
- What-If uses present tense ("is"), Comparison uses transition ("becomes")
- What-If has NO "Before" - only "After" exists
- Scene composition requires all 5 elements (WHO, DOING, WHERE, RESULT, WHEN)
- Immersion techniques focus on present tense, concrete metrics, and perspective
- Differentiation from comparison theme is now crystal clear in table format

**Differentiation Highlights:**
| Aspect | Comparison | What-If |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Structure | Left-right split | Single scene |
| Viewpoint | Observer (outside) | Participant (inside) |
| Focus | Prove difference | Immerse in vision |
| Metrics | Side-by-side numbers | Naturally embedded in scene |
| Tense | "A → B changes" | "B is" (already happening) |
| Emotion | Logical understanding | Emotional empathy |
