# Abstract Template

이 문서는 {{ name | title }} 논문의 Abstract 작성 템플릿입니다.

## Structure

{% if abstract_structure %}
{{ abstract_structure }}
{% else %}
**Standard Structure** (4-5 sentences):

1. **Background** (1-2 sentences): Context and motivation

{% else %}
- **Word count**: 150-250 words
- **Recommended**: 200 words
- **Sentences**: 5-7 sentences
{% endif %}

## Voice and Tense

{% if abstract_voice_tense %}
**Voice Ratio**:
- Active: {{ abstract_voice_tense.active }}%
- Passive: {{ abstract_voice_tense.passive }}%

**Tense Distribution**:
- Past: {{ abstract_voice_tense.past }}%
- Present: {{ abstract_voice_tense.present }}%

**Recommended Pattern**:
- Background: Present tense
- Objective: Past or present tense
- Methods: Past tense (passive voice preferred)
- Results: Past tense
- Conclusions: Present tense
{% else %}
**Voice Ratio**:
- Active: 70%
- Passive: 30%

**Tense Distribution**:
- Past: 60% (methods, results)
- Present: 40% (background, conclusions)
{% endif %}

## Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Background (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: Establish context and motivation

**Tense**: Present (for current state) or Past (for previous work)

- "Recent advances in [field] have enabled [capability]."

**Common Verbs**: face, require, enable, demonstrate, show

---

### 2. Objective (1 sentence)

**Purpose**: State research goal clearly

**Tense**: Past ("We developed...") or Present ("We present...")

**Voice**: Active (preferred)

**Examples**:
- "Here, we developed a novel approach to [objective]."
- "We present a comprehensive method for [objective]."
- "This study aimed to [objective]."

**Common Verbs**: develop, present, propose, aim, investigate

---

### 3. Methods (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: Describe approach and key techniques

**Tense**: Past

**Voice**: Passive (preferred) or Active

**Examples**:
- "We applied [method] to [dataset/system]."
- "[Method] was used to analyze [data]."
- "The approach combines [technique A] with [technique B]."

**Common Verbs**: apply, use, analyze, combine, employ

---

### 4. Results (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: Highlight main findings

**Tense**: Past

**Voice**: Active (for attribution) or Passive (for observations)

**Examples**:
- "We identified [number] [entities] associated with [outcome]."
- "The analysis revealed [finding]."
- "Our approach achieved [performance metric]."

**Common Verbs**: identify, reveal, demonstrate, show, achieve

---

### 5. Conclusions (1 sentence)

**Purpose**: State implications and significance

**Tense**: Present

**Voice**: Active or Passive

**Examples**:
- "These findings suggest [implication]."
- "This approach enables [application]."
- "Our results provide insights into [topic]."

**Common Verbs**: suggest, enable, provide, demonstrate, indicate

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

- ✓ Start with broad context, narrow to specific objective
- ✓ Use concrete numbers and metrics
- ✓ Highlight key innovation or finding
- ✓ End with clear take-home message
- ✓ Use active voice for main contributions
- ✓ Keep sentences concise and clear

### Don'ts

- ✗ Include citations (most journals prohibit)
- ✗ Use abbreviations without definition
- ✗ Include background information not directly relevant
- ✗ Overuse hedging language ("may", "might", "possibly")
- ✗ Include details better suited for Methods or Results
- ✗ End with vague statements

## Example Template

```
[Background: Present tense, 1-2 sentences]
Current approaches to [topic] face challenges in [problem]. 
Understanding [phenomenon] is crucial for [application].

[Objective: Past/Present tense, active voice, 1 sentence]
Here, we developed [method] to [objective].

[Methods: Past tense, passive voice preferred, 1-2 sentences]
We applied [technique] to [dataset/system]. 
The approach combines [method A] with [method B].

[Results: Past tense, 1-2 sentences]
We identified [number] [entities] associated with [outcome]. 
Our approach achieved [performance metric].

[Conclusions: Present tense, 1 sentence]
These findings suggest [implication] and enable [application].
```

## Checklist

Before finalizing your abstract, check:

- [ ] Length is within journal limits (typically 150-250 words)
- [ ] All 5 components are present (Background, Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusions)
- [ ] Voice/Tense ratios match target (Active ~70%, Past ~60%)
- [ ] No citations included
- [ ] Abbreviations are defined on first use
- [ ] Key findings are quantified with numbers
- [ ] Take-home message is clear
- [ ] Stands alone without reading full paper
- [ ] Accurately represents paper content

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much background**: Focus on what's directly relevant
   - Bad: "Protein folding has been studied for decades..."
   - Good: "Current protein folding methods face accuracy challenges..."

2. **Vague objectives**: Be specific
   - Bad: "We studied protein folding."
   - Good: "We developed a deep learning method to predict protein structures."

3. **Missing quantitative results**: Include numbers
   - Bad: "Our method performed well."
   - Good: "Our method achieved 95% accuracy."

4. **Weak conclusions**: State clear implications
   - Bad: "Our results are interesting."
   - Good: "These findings enable rapid drug target identification."
