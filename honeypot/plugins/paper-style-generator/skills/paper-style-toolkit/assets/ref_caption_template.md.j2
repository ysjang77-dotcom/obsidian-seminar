## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

- ✓ Use present tense for descriptions
- ✓ Use past tense for methods
- ✓ Define all abbreviations
- ✓ Specify sample sizes and error bars
- ✓ Describe each panel in multi-panel figures
- ✓ Use consistent terminology with main text
- ✓ Make captions self-contained (understandable without reading main text)

### Don'ts

- ✗ Interpret results (save for main text)
- ✗ Use vague terms ("various", "several")
- ✗ Omit statistical information
- ✗ Use undefined abbreviations
- ✗ Repeat main text verbatim
- ✗ Include unnecessary details

## Example Templates

### Single-Panel Figure

```
Figure 1. Distribution of [parameter] across [conditions]. Each point 
represents [entity] (n = [X]). Colors indicate [category]. Error bars 
represent mean ± SD. Asterisks indicate statistical significance 
(*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
```

### Multi-Panel Figure

```
Figure 2. Effect of [treatment] on [outcome]. (A) [Description of panel A]. 
(B) [Description of panel B]. (C) [Description of panel C]. Data are from 
n = [X] independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SEM. 
Abbreviations: [ABBR1], [full name 1]; [ABBR2], [full name 2].
```

### Schematic Figure

```
Figure 3. Schematic representation of [process/system]. [Description of 
key components and their relationships]. Arrows indicate [direction/flow]. 
Colors represent [categories].
```

### Correlation Figure

```
Figure 4. Correlation between [variable A] and [variable B]. Each point 
represents [entity] (n = [X]). The solid line represents linear regression 
(r = [value], P < 0.001). The shaded area represents 95% confidence interval.
```

### Simple Table

```
Table 1. Summary statistics for [dataset]. Values are presented as 
mean ± SD (n = [X]).
```

### Comparison Table

```
Table 2. Comparison of [parameter] across [groups]. P-values were 
calculated using [test]. Abbreviations: [ABBR1], [full name 1]; 
[ABBR2], [full name 2].
```

## Panel Labeling

### Multi-Panel Figures

**Format**: (A), (B), (C), etc.

**Placement**: Top-left corner of each panel (in figure) or at start of description (in caption)

**Description order**: Left to right, top to bottom

**Example**:
```
Figure 5. [Title]. (A) [Panel A description]. (B) [Panel B description]. 
(C) [Panel C description]. (D) [Panel D description].
```

### Sub-Panels

**Format**: (A1), (A2), (B1), (B2), etc.

**Example**:
```
Figure 6. [Title]. (A) [Main panel A]. (A1) [Sub-panel A1]. (A2) [Sub-panel A2]. 
(B) [Main panel B]. (B1) [Sub-panel B1]. (B2) [Sub-panel B2].
```

## Statistical Notation in Captions

### Error Bars

**Format**: "Error bars represent [type] (n = [X])"

**Examples**:
- "Error bars represent mean ± SD (n = 30)."
- "Error bars represent mean ± SEM from n = 3 independent experiments."
- "Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals."

### Significance Indicators

**Format**: "Asterisks indicate statistical significance ([levels])"

**Examples**:
- "*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001"
- "*P < 0.05 vs. control"
- "Different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05)"

### Sample Sizes

**Format**: "n = [X]" or "(n = [X])"

**Examples**:
- "Data are from n = 30 samples."
- "Each group contained n = 10 animals."
- "Results are from n = 3 independent experiments."

## Checklist

Before finalizing your captions, check:

- [ ] Title sentence clearly states what is shown
- [ ] All panels are described (for multi-panel figures)
- [ ] Sample sizes are provided (n = X)
- [ ] Error bars are defined (mean ± SD or SEM)
- [ ] Statistical significance is indicated
- [ ] All abbreviations are defined
- [ ] Voice/Tense ratios match target (Passive ~70%, Present ~70%)
- [ ] Captions are self-contained (understandable without main text)
- [ ] Terminology is consistent with main text
- [ ] No interpretation included (only description)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague titles**: "Results of experiment."
   - Better: "Effect of temperature on enzyme activity."

2. **Missing panel descriptions**: "Figure shows results."
   - Better: "(A) Control group. (B) Treatment group."

3. **Undefined error bars**: "Error bars are shown."
   - Better: "Error bars represent mean ± SD (n = 30)."

4. **Undefined abbreviations**: "WT and KO samples."
   - Better: "Wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) samples."

5. **Including interpretation**: "This shows that treatment is effective."
   - Better: "Effect of treatment on outcome." (Interpretation goes in main text)
