## Hedging Language

Use hedging to avoid overstating conclusions:

**High certainty**:
- "likely", "probably", "appears to", "seems to"

**Moderate certainty**:
- "may", "might", "could", "possibly"

**Low certainty**:
- "suggests", "indicates", "implies", "potentially"

**Examples**:
- Strong: "This causes [effect]."
- Hedged: "This may contribute to [effect]."
- Strong: "The results prove [claim]."
- Hedged: "The results suggest [claim]."

See [references/vocabulary.md](references/vocabulary.md) for complete list.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Repeating Results**: "We found X, Y, and Z." (already in Results)
   - Better: "These findings suggest that [interpretation]."

2. **Overstating conclusions**: "This proves that..."
   - Better: "These results suggest that..."

3. **Ignoring limitations**: Not mentioning any constraints
   - Better: "This study has several limitations. First, ..."

4. **Vague implications**: "This is important."
   - Better: "This enables [specific application] by [mechanism]."

5. **Weak conclusions**: "More research is needed."
   - Better: "Future studies should investigate [specific question] to [objective]."
