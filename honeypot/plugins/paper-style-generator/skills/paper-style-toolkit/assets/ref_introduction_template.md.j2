## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

- ✓ Use funnel structure (broad → specific)
- ✓ Cite relevant previous work
- ✓ Clearly state research gap
- ✓ Use active voice for your contributions
- ✓ Include specific examples and numbers
- ✓ Use transition phrases between paragraphs

### Don'ts

- ✗ Include methods or results details
- ✗ Overcite (focus on most relevant work)
- ✗ Use vague statements ("many studies", "some researchers")
- ✗ Criticize previous work harshly
- ✗ Include unnecessary background
- ✗ Repeat abstract verbatim

## Checklist

Before finalizing your introduction, check:

- [ ] Funnel structure (broad → specific) is followed
- [ ] Research gap is clearly identified
- [ ] Objective is stated clearly and specifically
- [ ] Key contributions are highlighted
- [ ] Relevant previous work is cited
- [ ] Voice/Tense ratios match target (Active ~60%, Present ~60%)
- [ ] Transition phrases connect paragraphs smoothly
- [ ] No methods or results details included
- [ ] Length is within recommended range (800-1200 words)
- [ ] All citations are formatted correctly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much background**: Focus on what's directly relevant
   - Bad: "Proteins were discovered in 1838..."
   - Good: "Protein structure prediction is crucial for drug design..."

2. **Vague problem statement**: Be specific
   - Bad: "Current methods have some problems."
   - Good: "Current methods achieve only 60% accuracy on complex structures."

3. **Missing research gap**: Clearly state what's missing
   - Bad: "We developed a new method."
   - Good: "Existing methods do not account for [factor]. We developed a method that addresses this gap."

4. **Weak contributions**: Highlight what's novel
   - Bad: "We applied machine learning to protein folding."
   - Good: "We introduce a novel architecture that improves accuracy by 20%."
