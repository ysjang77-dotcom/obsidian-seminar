## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

- ✓ Use passive voice for procedures
- ✓ Use past tense for actions performed
- ✓ Include sufficient detail for replication
- ✓ Specify all parameters (temperature, time, concentration)
- ✓ Cite methods from previous studies when appropriate
- ✓ Use subsections to organize content
- ✓ Include sample sizes and replicates

### Don'ts

- ✗ Include results or interpretation
- ✗ Use vague descriptions ("appropriate amount", "suitable conditions")
- ✗ Omit critical parameters
- ✗ Mix methods and results
- ✗ Use first person excessively ("I did", "we performed")
- ✗ Include unnecessary background

## Example Template

```
[Overview paragraph - Past/Present tense]
We employed a [approach] to [objective]. The study consisted of three 
main steps: (1) [step 1], (2) [step 2], and (3) [step 3].

### Materials and Reagents

[Past tense, Passive voice]
Samples were collected from [source] between [dates]. [Reagent A] was 
purchased from [supplier] (catalog number: [number]). [Reagent B] was 
obtained from [supplier] and stored at [temperature].

### Sample Preparation

[Past tense, Passive voice]
Samples were prepared by [procedure]. Briefly, [detailed steps]. 
The reaction was performed at [temperature] for [time]. 

### Measurement

[Past tense, Passive voice]
Measurements were performed using [instrument] (model [X], manufacturer). 
Parameters were set as follows: [parameter 1] = [value], [parameter 2] = [value]. 
Each sample was measured in triplicate.

### Data Analysis

[Past tense, Passive voice]
Data were analyzed using [software] (version [X]). Statistical significance 
was determined using [test] (α = 0.05). Results are presented as mean ± SD 
from n = [X] independent experiments.
```

## Supplier and Instrument Information

### Reagents and Materials

**Format**: `[Item] was purchased from [Supplier] ([Location]; catalog number: [Number])`

**Examples**:
- "Antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK; catalog number: ab12345)."
- "Cell culture media were obtained from Gibco (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)."

### Instruments and Equipment

**Format**: `[Measurement] was performed using [Instrument] (model [X], [Manufacturer], [Location])`

**Examples**:
- "Absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA)."
- "Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM 880, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)."

### Software

**Format**: `[Analysis] was performed using [Software] (version [X], [Developer], [Location])`

**Examples**:
- "Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA)."
- "Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.0.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

## Checklist

Before finalizing your methodology, check:

- [ ] All procedures are described in sufficient detail for replication
- [ ] Voice/Tense ratios match target (Passive ~80%, Past ~90%)
- [ ] All parameters are specified (temperature, time, concentration, etc.)
- [ ] Sample sizes and replicates are stated
- [ ] Suppliers and catalog numbers are provided for reagents
- [ ] Instrument models and manufacturers are specified
- [ ] Software versions are included
- [ ] Statistical methods are clearly described
- [ ] Subsections are logically organized
- [ ] No results or interpretation included
- [ ] All measurements follow standard format (see references/measurement.md)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Insufficient detail**: "Samples were prepared appropriately."
   - Better: "Samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h."

2. **Missing parameters**: "The reaction was performed."
   - Better: "The reaction was performed at 25 °C for 2 h with stirring at 500 rpm."

3. **Vague quantities**: "A small amount of reagent was added."
   - Better: "10 μL of reagent (10 mM) was added."

4. **Missing supplier information**: "Antibodies were purchased."
   - Better: "Antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK; catalog number: ab12345)."

5. **Including results**: "Samples were analyzed and showed high purity."
   - Better: "Sample purity was analyzed using HPLC." (Results go in Results section)
