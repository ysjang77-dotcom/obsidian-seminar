{% endif %}

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Attribution

**Use Active Voice when**:
- Attributing findings to your work: "We observed...", "We identified..."
- Describing your actions: "We analyzed...", "We compared..."

**Use Passive Voice when**:
- Describing observations: "A significant increase was observed..."
- Stating results objectively: "The correlation was found to be..."

**Limit "We" Usage**:
- Target: ≤30% of sentences
- Alternate between active and passive
- Use passive for variety: "Analysis revealed..." instead of "We found..."

### Tense Usage

**Past Tense** (primary):
- Specific findings: "The analysis revealed..."
- Observations: "We observed..."
- Measurements: "The concentration was measured..."

**Present Tense** (secondary):
- Figure references: "Figure 1 shows..."
- General statements: "The data indicate..."
- Current state: "The results demonstrate..."

## Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Overview (optional)

**Purpose**: Briefly summarize main findings

**Tense**: Past or Present

**Voice**: Active or Passive

**Content**:
- What are the key findings?
- How do they address the research question?

**Examples**:
- "We identified [number] [entities] associated with [outcome]."
- "The analysis revealed [finding 1], [finding 2], and [finding 3]."
- "Our approach achieved [performance metric] on [dataset]."

**Length**: 1-2 sentences

---

### 2. Primary Results

**Purpose**: Present main experimental findings

**Tense**: Past (primary)

**Voice**: Mix of Active and Passive

**Content**:
- What was observed?
- What are the quantitative results?
- How do results relate to figures/tables?

#### Subsection Structure

Each subsection should:
1. State the objective or question
2. Describe the approach (briefly)
3. Present the findings with data
4. Reference figures/tables
5. Provide statistical support

#### Example Subsection

```
### [Subsection Title]

[Objective - 1 sentence]
To investigate [question], we [approach].

[Findings - 2-3 sentences with data]
We observed [finding] (Figure 1A). Specifically, [detail] 
([quantitative result], n = [X], P < 0.05). This finding 
was consistent across [conditions] (Figure 1B).

[Statistical support]
Statistical analysis revealed [result] (mean ± SD: [value], 
95% CI: [range], P = [value]).
```

---

### 3. Figure and Table References

**Format**: "Figure X shows...", "Table X presents...", "As shown in Figure X..."

**Tense**: Present (for figure references)

**Examples**:
- "Figure 1 shows the distribution of [data]."
- "As shown in Figure 2A, [finding]."
- "Table 1 presents the summary statistics."
- "The correlation is illustrated in Figure 3."

**Integration**: Reference figures/tables in context, not in isolation

**Bad**: "Figure 1 shows the results."
**Good**: "We observed a significant increase in [parameter] (Figure 1)."

---

### 4. Quantitative Results

**Always include**:
- Specific numbers
- Statistical measures (mean, SD, SEM)
- Sample sizes (n = X)
- P-values
- Effect sizes (when appropriate)

**Format examples**:
- "The concentration increased from [X] to [Y] ([Z]%, n = [N], P < 0.05)."
- "We observed a significant correlation (r = 0.85, P < 0.001, n = 100)."
- "The mean value was [X] ± [Y] (SD) across [n] samples."

See [references/measurement.md](references/measurement.md) for formatting.

---

### 5. Statistical Reporting

**P-values**:
- Format: `P < 0.05`, `P = 0.023`, `P < 0.001`
- Always include in parentheses after claim
- Report exact values when P > 0.001

**Descriptive statistics**:
- Format: `mean ± SD` or `mean ± SEM`
- Always specify which measure is used
- Include sample size: `n = X`

**Confidence intervals**:
- Format: `95% CI: [lower]-[upper]`
- Include with effect sizes

**Examples**:
- "Group A showed higher values than Group B (25.3 ± 2.1 vs. 18.7 ± 1.8, P < 0.001, n = 30 per group)."
- "The correlation was significant (r = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.90, P < 0.001)."

---

## Writing Patterns

### Presenting Findings

**Pattern 1: Observation + Data + Figure**
```
We observed [finding]. Specifically, [detail] ([quantitative result], 
n = [X], P < 0.05, Figure 1A).
```

**Pattern 2: Comparison + Statistics**
```
[Group A] showed significantly higher [parameter] compared to [Group B] 
([value A] vs. [value B], P < 0.001, n = [X]).
```

**Pattern 3: Trend + Evidence**
```
[Parameter] increased with [variable] (r = 0.85, P < 0.001, Figure 2). 
This trend was consistent across [conditions].
```

### Describing Relationships

**Correlation**:
- "We found a significant positive correlation between [X] and [Y] (r = 0.85, P < 0.001)."
- "[X] was positively correlated with [Y] (Figure 3)."

**Comparison**:
- "[Group A] showed significantly higher [parameter] than [Group B] (P < 0.001)."
- "No significant difference was observed between [Group A] and [Group B] (P = 0.15)."

**Trend**:
- "[Parameter] increased with [variable] (Figure 4)."
- "A dose-dependent response was observed (Figure 5)."

### Negative Results

**Report objectively**:
- "No significant difference was observed between [A] and [B] (P = 0.15)."
- "We did not detect [entity] in [sample]."
- "[Treatment] had no effect on [parameter] (P = 0.42)."

**Avoid**:
- "Unfortunately, we did not find..."
- "The experiment failed to show..."

- ✗ Include methods details
- ✗ Cite literature (except for methods)
- ✗ Use vague terms ("high", "low", "many")

- ✗ Include raw data (use figures/tables)
- ✗ Repeat figure captions verbatim
- ✗ Speculate about mechanisms

## Example Template

```
[Optional Overview - Past/Present tense]
We identified [number] [entities] associated with [outcome]. 
The analysis revealed [finding 1], [finding 2], and [finding 3].

### [Primary Result 1]

[Objective]
To investigate [question], we [approach].

[Findings with data]
We observed [finding] (Figure 1A). Specifically, [parameter] was 
[value] ± [SD] in [condition A] compared to [value] ± [SD] in 
[condition B] (n = [X], P < 0.001). This difference was consistent 
across [conditions] (Figure 1B).

[Statistical support]
Statistical analysis revealed a significant effect of [factor] 
(F([df1], [df2]) = [value], P < 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed 
[specific comparisons].

## Checklist

Before finalizing your results, check:

- [ ] All findings are presented objectively without interpretation

- [ ] "We" usage is ≤30%
- [ ] Sample sizes are provided (n = X)
- [ ] P-values are reported correctly
- [ ] Measurements follow standard format
- [ ] Negative results are reported
- [ ] No methods details included

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Interpretation in Results**: "This suggests that..." → Move to Discussion
2. **Vague descriptions**: "The value was high." → "The value was 25.3 ± 2.1 mg/dL."
3. **Missing statistics**: "Group A was higher than Group B." → "Group A was significantly higher than Group B (P < 0.001)."
4. **Overusing "we"**: "We found... We observed... We analyzed..." → Mix with passive voice
5. **Unreferenced figures**: "The results are shown in Figure 1." → "We observed [finding] (Figure 1)."
