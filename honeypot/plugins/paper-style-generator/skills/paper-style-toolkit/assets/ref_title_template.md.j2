# Title Template

이 문서는 {{ name | title }} 논문의 제목 작성 템플릿입니다.

## Structure

{% if title_structure %}
{{ title_structure }}
{% else %}
**Typical Structure**:
1. Main topic or method
2. Key innovation or finding
3. Application or context (optional)

**Format Options**:
- Single-line: "Main Topic: Key Innovation"
- Two-part: "Main Topic | Application Context"
- Descriptive: "Adjective + Noun + Prepositional Phrase"
{% endif %}

## Length Guidelines

{% if title_length %}
- **Typical length**: {{ title_length.min }}-{{ title_length.max }} words
- **Character count**: {{ title_length.char_min }}-{{ title_length.char_max }} characters
- **Recommended**: {{ title_length.recommended }} words
{% else %}
- **Typical length**: 10-15 words
- **Character count**: 80-120 characters
- **Recommended**: 12 words
{% endif %}

## Key Components

### Essential Elements

1. **Main Topic**: What is the paper about?
   - Example: "Machine Learning", "Protein Folding", "Drug Discovery"

2. **Key Innovation**: What is new or different?
   - Example: "Novel Approach", "Deep Learning-Based", "High-Throughput"

3. **Application/Context** (optional): Where is it applied?
   - Example: "for Cancer Diagnosis", "in Alzheimer's Disease", "using Single-Cell Data"

### Optional Elements

- **Method indicator**: "A Novel Method for...", "An Approach to..."
- **Outcome indicator**: "Enables...", "Reveals...", "Demonstrates..."
- **Scope indicator**: "Comprehensive", "Systematic", "Comparative"

## Style Guidelines

### Capitalization

{% if title_capitalization %}
**Style**: {{ title_capitalization }}
{% else %}
**Title Case** (most common):
- Capitalize: First word, last word, all major words
- Lowercase: Articles (a, an, the), conjunctions (and, but, or), prepositions (in, on, at)
- Example: "A Novel Approach to Machine Learning for Cancer Diagnosis"

**Sentence case** (alternative):
- Capitalize: First word only (plus proper nouns)
- Example: "A novel approach to machine learning for cancer diagnosis"
{% endif %}

### Punctuation

- **Colon**: Separate main topic from subtitle
  - "Main Topic: Detailed Description"
- **Hyphen**: Connect compound modifiers
  - "Deep Learning-Based Approach"
- **Avoid**: Question marks, exclamation points, periods

### Word Choice

**Preferred**:
- Novel, innovative, advanced, comprehensive
- Enables, reveals, demonstrates, identifies
- High-throughput, large-scale, multi-modal

**Avoid**:
- Vague terms: "study of", "investigation of"
- Redundant phrases: "a study on the study of"
- Jargon without context

## Common Patterns

{% if title_patterns %}
{% for pattern in title_patterns %}
### Pattern {{ loop.index }}: {{ pattern.name }}

**Structure**: {{ pattern.structure }}

**Example**: {{ pattern.example }}

**When to use**: {{ pattern.usage }}

---

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
### Pattern 1: Method + Application

**Structure**: "[Method] for [Application]"

**Example**: "Deep Learning for Protein Structure Prediction"

**When to use**: When method is the main contribution

---

### Pattern 2: Topic + Innovation

**Structure**: "[Topic]: [Innovation]"

**Example**: "Cancer Diagnosis: A Machine Learning Approach"

**When to use**: When innovation is the main contribution

---

### Pattern 3: Outcome + Method

**Structure**: "[Outcome] using [Method]"

**Example**: "Identifying Drug Targets using Network Analysis"

**When to use**: When outcome is the main focus

---

### Pattern 4: Comprehensive Description

**Structure**: "[Adjective] [Method] for [Application] in [Context]"

**Example**: "A Comprehensive Machine Learning Framework for Drug Discovery in Oncology"

**When to use**: When full context is needed

{% endif %}

## Examples from {{ name | title }}

{% if title_examples %}
{% for example in title_examples %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ example }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
1. [Example 1: Method-focused title]
2. [Example 2: Application-focused title]
3. [Example 3: Outcome-focused title]
{% endif %}

## Checklist

Before finalizing your title, check:

- [ ] Length is within recommended range (10-15 words)
- [ ] Main topic is clear and specific
- [ ] Key innovation is highlighted
- [ ] Capitalization follows journal style
- [ ] No unnecessary words ("study of", "investigation of")
- [ ] No jargon without context
- [ ] Accurately reflects paper content
- [ ] Engaging and informative
- [ ] Searchable keywords included

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too vague**: "A Study on Machine Learning"
   - Better: "Deep Learning for Protein Structure Prediction"

2. **Too long**: "A Comprehensive Investigation of the Application of Novel Machine Learning Techniques to the Problem of Protein Structure Prediction in the Context of Drug Discovery"
   - Better: "Machine Learning for Protein Structure Prediction in Drug Discovery"

3. **Too technical**: "LSTM-CNN Hybrid Architecture for QSAR Modeling"
   - Better: "Deep Learning for Drug Activity Prediction"

4. **Missing key information**: "A Novel Approach"
   - Better: "A Novel Machine Learning Approach for Cancer Diagnosis"
