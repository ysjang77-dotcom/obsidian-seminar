<p>The Python reliability library is free and open source, and it always will be. It aims to provide students and professionals alike with a set of powerful tools to make reliability engineering more efficient. Many of these tools are otherwise only found in commercial software which is prohibitively expensive, especially for individuals. I began developing this library while I was a student because I found there was nothing like it available for free.</p>
<p>Developing and maintaining this library is all done in my spare time and is a very time consuming process. If you would like to donate as a way of showing your appreciation, you can send a one off donation using <a class="reference external" href="https://paypal.me/MatthewReid854?locale.x=en_AU">Paypal</a> or a monthly donation by becoming a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sponsors/MatthewReid854">GitHub Sponsor</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why you should pay for something that is already free, GitHub has a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sponsors">great explaination</a> on the importance of investing in the software that powers your world.</p>
<p>Thank you to the following <cite>reliability</cite> donors for their generous support of open source development :)</p>
