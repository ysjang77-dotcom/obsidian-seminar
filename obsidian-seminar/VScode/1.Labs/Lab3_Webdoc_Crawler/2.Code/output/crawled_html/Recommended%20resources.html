<h1>Recommended resources<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-resources" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The following collection of resources are things I have found useful during my reliability engineering studies and also while writing the Python reliability library. There are many other resources available (especially textbooks and academic papers), so I encourage you to do your own research. If you find something you think is worth adding here, please send me an email (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:alpha.reliability%40gmail.com">alpha<span>.</span>reliability<span>@</span>gmail<span>.</span>com</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Paid software</strong></p>
<p>The listing of a software package here does not imply my endorsement, and is only intended to give readers an understanding of the broad range of reliability engineering software packages that are available. It is difficult to find a comprehensive list of software resources since most developers of proprietary software rarely acknowledge the existence of any software other than their own. I have not used most of the paid software listed here due to the high cost, so most of my comments in this section are based purely on the content from their websites.</p>
