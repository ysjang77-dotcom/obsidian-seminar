<dd><p>This function plots the accept/reject boundaries for a given set of quality
and risk levels. If supplied, the test results are also plotted on the
chart.</p>
<p>A sequential sampling chart provides decision boundaries so that a
success/failure test may be stopped as soon as there have been enough
successes or enough failures to exceed the decision boundary. The decision
boundary is calculated based on four parameters; producer’s quality,
consumer’s quality, producer’s risk, and consumer’s risk. Producer’s risk
is the chance that the consumer rejects a batch when they should have
accepted it. Consumer’s risk is the chance that the consumer accepts a batch
when they should have rejected it. We can also consider the producer’s and
consumer’s quality to be the desired reliability of the sample, and the
producer’s and consumer’s risk to be 1-confidence interval that the sample
test result matches the population test result.</p>
<dl class="field-list simple">
<dt class="field-odd">Parameters<span class="colon">:</span></dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>p1</strong> (<em>float</em>) – The producer’s quality. This is the acceptable failure rate for the
producer. Must be between 0 and 1 but is usually very small, typically
around 0.01.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>p2</strong> (<em>float</em>) – The consumer’s quality. This is the acceptable failure rate for the
consumer. Must be between 0 and 1 but is usually very small, typically
around 0.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>alpha</strong> (<em>float</em>) – The producer’s risk. The probability of accepting a batch when it should
have been rejected. Producer’s CI = 1-alpha. Must be between 0 and 1 but
is usually very small, typically 0.05.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>beta</strong> (<em>float</em>) – The consumer’s risk. The probability of the consumer rejecting a batch
when it should have been accepted. Consumer’s CI = 1-beta. Must be
between 0 and 1 but is usually very small, typically 0.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test_results</strong> (<em>array, list, optional</em>) – The binary test results. eg. [0,0,0,1] represents 3 successes and 1
failure. Default=None. Use 0 for success and 1 for failure as this test
is counting the number of failures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>show_plot</strong> (<em>bool, optional</em>) – If True the plot will be produced. Default = True.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>print_results</strong> (<em>bool, optional</em>) – If True the results will be printed to the console. Default = True.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>max_samples</strong> (<em>int, optional</em>) – The upper x-limit of the plot. Default = 100.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt class="field-even">Returns<span class="colon">:</span></dt>
<dd class="field-even"><p><strong>results</strong> (<em>dataframe</em>) – A dataframe of tabulated decision results with the columns “Samples”,
“Failures to accept”, “Failures to reject”. This is independent of the
test_results provided.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p class="rubric">Notes</p>
<p>If show_plot is True, the sequential sampling chart with decision boundaries
will be produced. The test_results are only plotted on the chart if provided
as an input. The chart will display automatically so plt.show() is not
required.</p>
